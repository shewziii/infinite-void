1. **What is the project?**
	Interactive session tracker. It will capture "clock in" and "clock out" times to record time elapsed while working. It will do this by taking the first time stamp and subtracting from it the second time stamp, then store this value to add to a final time elapsed value.

2. **What is the MVP? (Minimal viable product)**
	The MVP of this project will be a simple cli app for linux. It will prompt the user to press a key, the 'I' key for 'clock In', the 'O' key for 'clock Out', and the d key to finish the day. It will calculate the total time spent 'clocked in' and output that, along with the timestamps correlating to each time 'clocked in' and 'clocked' out.

3. **What are the nice to haves?**
    Nice to haves include:
    - [ ] Project tracking to keep a history of all projects and their data
    - [ ] Project indexing so user can choose to display only the project they want to see data for

4. **When will the project be complete?**
    No time frame
