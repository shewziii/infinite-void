# Responding to Objections
Objections are concerns or a question raised by the buyer
- encourage your buyers to voice concerns or questions - a hidden objection cannot be dealt with and will delay or stop the sale altogether
- have a positive attitude about objections and expect them in every sales call

Objections often happen:
- setting up the initial appointment
- during the presentation
- attempting to obtain commitment
- after the sale
# Types of Objections: Conditions
Conditions are valid and legitimate reasons for not going ahead with a slaw, a reality condition that prevents the person from buying: can't afford it, doesn't need it, etc. Sometimes the customer may not have the authority to make the decision. They might not be able to spend that much money, need approval from an overseas parent company, or the might need a purchasing manager or CEO to sign off on it.

Often, nothing you do in these situations will result in a signed contract:
- ask questions to determine the nature of the condition
- schedule the appointment for a time when he condition requirements have been met

The real secret to handling conditions is to find out about them as soon as possible.
# Types of Objections: Stalls/"Smoke Screens"
Stalls are the most common form of objection. They are basically when people tell you something along the lines of "I'm busy", "Just send it to me", "we want to think it over", etc. These happen if you don't engage them right away, they don't see enough value, or they need more information

## Common Objections
**Time**: "I'll need some time to think about this"
**Money**: "Your price is too high"
**Need**: "Not really what we're looking for right now"
**Product**: "We're gonna need more information about it"

# 7 Proven Ways to Overcome Objections
## Direct Denial Method
At times you will face objections based on incomplete or inaccurate information from the buyer. Respond using a direct denial method and provide the buyer with the correct facts. Make sure your statement is strong and indicate the error the prospect has made
## Indirect Denial Method
This method is often a good choice because it is non-confrontational. You can take the edge of the objection by agreeing with the prospect but only to the extent that the agreement does not weaken the validity of your denial later in your presentation. you may want to invite the buyer to tell you more, instead of challenging or denying how they view things, you're validating their viewpoint and reopening the conversation. By not trying to counter the "objection," you allow the dialogue to move back to a discussion that focuses on whether you're a good match for each other.
## Compensation
Every product or service has some advantages and disadvantages compared to the competition. No absolutely perfect product or service has ever been developed. A buyer will always need to make a cost benefit decision. you can use this method to overcome objections when a buyer has a valid objection. Your goal is to overcome the objection by showing any compensating advantages.
## Feel-Felt-Found Method (Referral Method)
When buyers' attitudes reflect their own attitudes or opinions, the salesperson can show how others held similar views before trying the product or service. The referral method attempts to show their initial personal opinions may be unfounded after they try the product. This method allows you to build a story to handle the objection. The following sequence is typically used with this method.
## Boomerang Method
Turn the objection into a reason for buying the product or service. This method can be used in many situations (when making an appointment, during a presentation, attempting to secure a commitment, and in post-sale situations). use this method very cautiously because it can appear pushy.
## Acknowledge Method
Sometimes a buyer voices an opinion or concern more to vent frustration than anything else. When this happens, the best strategy may be to simply let the buyer talk. After the buyer finishes talking, acknowledge that you heard the concern and then move on to another topic.
## Postpone Method
In the early stages of a sales call the buyer may raise objections that the salesperson would prefer to answer later in the presentation, after discovering the prospect's needs. By using the postpone method, the salesperson would ask permission to answer the question later in the presentation. Make sure you use an active listening technique and write down the question so you do in fact address the objections at some point in your sales call.

# LAARC Method of Responding to Objections
## Listen
Be sure that you fully understand their hesitation. be a good listener and hear what they have to say, utilize non-verbals, and uncover what it is that they're really concerned with. Be clear about what you hear so you can ask a clarifying question.
## Acknowledge Their Concern
Show empathy and understanding
- I'm sorry to hear that you had that experience
- I can understand your concern
- That makes a lot of sense, I can see why you'd want some clarification on that
## Assess
Probe further with additional question if it's not clear. Don't make any assumptions about anything. Be sure it's a valid objection and not a smoke screen.
## Response
Respond to their objection the best you can. If they have a true concern that can be handled, be sure to use and appropriate response method. Support your response with evidence
## Confirm to ensure the buyer no longer has this concern
Check back and ask if they still have the same hesitation as before. if they do, go further in-depth with your response. If they seem to feel better now, you can try to close the sale.
