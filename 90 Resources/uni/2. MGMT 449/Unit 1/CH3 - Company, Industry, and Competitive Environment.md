# Using the Five-Forces Model
Step 1:
For each of the five forces, identify the different parties involved, along with the specific factors that bring about competitive pressures

Step 2:
Evaluate how strong the pressures stemming from each of the five forces are (strong, moderate, or weak)

Step 3: Determining whether the five forces, overall, are supportive of high industry profitability

---
# Rivalry Increases When...
- Buyer demand is growing slowly or declining
- It is becoming less costly for buyers to switch brands
- industry products are becoming less differentiated
- There is unused production capacity, or products have high fixed costs or high storage costs
- The number of competitors is increasing or they are becoming more equal in size and competitive strength
- The diversity of competitors is increasing 
- High exit barriers keep firms from exiting the industry

---
# Entry Threat Considerations
- Expected defensive reactions of incumbent firms
- Strength of barriers to entry
- Attractiveness of a particular market's growth in demand and profit potential
- Capabilities and resources of potential segments in which they have no current presence

---
# Entry Barriers Facing New Entrants
- Incumbent cost advantages related to learning and experience, proprietary patents and technology, favorable locations, and lower fixed costs
- Strong brand preferences and customer loyalty 
- Strong "network effects" in customer demand
- High capital requirements
- Building a network of distributors or dealers and securing adequate space on retailers' shelves
- Restrictive regulatory and trade policies

---
# Competitive Pressure from Substitute Products
Substitute Product Considerations
- Readily available and attractively priced?
- Comparable or better in terms of quality, performance, and other relevant attributes?
- Offer lower switching costs to buyers?

Indicators of Substitutes' Competitive Strength
- Increasing rate of growth in sales of substitutes 
- Substitute producers adding new output capacity 
- increasing profitability of substitute producers

---
# Supplier Bargaining Power Depends On...
- Strength of demand for and availability of suppliers' products
- Whether suppliers provide a differentiated input that enhances the performance of the industry's product 
- Industry members' costs for switching among suppliers
- Size and number of suppliers relative to industry members 
- Possibility of backward integration into suppliers' industry
- Fraction of the cost of the supplier's product relative to the total cost of the industry's product
- Availability of good substitutes for suppliers' products

---
# Buyer Bargaining Power Depends On...
- Strength of buyers’ demand for sellers’ products
- Degree to which industry goods are differentiated
- Buyers’ costs for switching to competing sellers or substitutes
- Number and size of buyers relative to number of sellers
- Threat of buyers’ integration into sellers’ industry
- Buyers’ knowledge of products, costs and pricing
- Buyers’ discretion in delaying purchases
- Buyers’ price sensitivity due to low profits, size of purchase, and consequences of purchase

---
# Is The Collective Strength of the Five Forces Conductive to Profitability
- Is the state of competition in the industry stronger than normal?
- Can industry firms expect to earn decent profits given prevailing competitive forces?
- Are some of the competitive forces sufficiently powerful to undermine industry profitability?
    - Even one powerful force may be enough to make the industry unattractive in terms of its profit potential

---
# Strategic Group
Consists of those industry members with similar competitive approaches and positions in the market
- Having comparable product-line breadth
- Emphasizing the same distribution channels
- Depending on identical technological approaches 
- Offering the same product attributes to buyers
- Offering similar services and technical assistance

---
# Constructing a Strategic Group Map
Basic Guidelines
- Axes should not be highly correlated
- Variables should expose big differences 
- Circles are proportional to represent sales
- If several variables are identified, several maps can be created

---
# Common Variables for Strategic Group Maps
- Price/quality range (high, medium, low)
- Geographic coverage (local, regional, national, global)
- Product-line breadth (wide, narrow)
- Degree of service offered (no frills, limited, full)
- Distribution channels (retail, wholesale, Internet, multiple)
- Degree of vertical integration (none, partial, full)
- Degree of diversification into other industries (none, some, considerable)
