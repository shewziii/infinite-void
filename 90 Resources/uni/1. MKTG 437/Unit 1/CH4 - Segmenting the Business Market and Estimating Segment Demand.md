# Methods of Forecasting Demand

# **Qualitative Techniques**
Called management judgement or subjective techniques 
- Rely on informed judgement and rating schemes
- Include the executive judgement method, the sales force composite method, and the Delphi method

**Executive Judgement**
- Combines and averages top executives' estimates of future sales
- Easy to apply and understand
- Limitations 
    - Does not systematically analyze cause and effect relationships 
    - New executives may have difficulty making reasonable forecasts 
    - Difficult to assess the accuracy of the method 
- Produces accurate forecasts when: 
    - They are made frequently and repetitively
    - Environment is stable
    - Linkage between decision, action, and feedback is short 

 **Sales Force Composite**
- Sales force knows their customers, markets, and competition, and they can estimate the sales volume effectively 
- Sales force's involvement in forecasting process boosts their incentives to achieve desired sales levels 

- Benefits
    - Ability to draw on sales force knowledge about markets and customers
    - Executed with relative ease at minimal cost
- Limitations 
    - Does not involve systematic analysis of cause and effect
    - Reliance on informed judgement and opinions 
    - Overestimation of the forecast to look good

**Delphi Method**
Opinions of a panel of experts on future sales are converted into an informed consensus through a highly structured feedback mechanism

Process involved 
- Written opinions about the likelihood of some future event are sought 
- Responses to the first questionnaire are used to produce a second one
- Analyst assembles, clarifies, and consolidates information for dissemination in the succeeding round

Generally applied to long term forecasting of demand

Suitable for new products or for situations that are not well suited for quantitative analysis 

Difficult to measure the accuracy of the estimates

# **Quantitative Techniques**
Called systematic or objective forecasting
- Offers time series and regression or causal methodologies

**Time Series**
Uses historical data ordered chronologically to project the trend and growth rate of sales
- Past patterns can be applied to the future

Time series of sales may include trends, seasonal, cyclical, and irregular patterns

Well suited for short range forecasting 

**Regression or Causal Analysis**
Identifies factors that have affected past sales and implements them in a mathematical model

Forecast is derived by:
- Projecting values for each of the factors in the model
- Inserting these values into the regression equation
- Solving for expected sales
- Reliable for intermediate forecasts

---
# Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment
One individual in the firm is given the responsibility for coordinating the forecasting process with functional managers across the firm
- Parties who may influence sales performance will participate directly in the demand estimation process

Results in a very accurate forecast of demand due to the intensive sharing of information
