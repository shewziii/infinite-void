A [[channel of distribution]] is the link between the manufacturer and the customer. It accomplishes all the tasks necessary to get the product or service to the customer. Tasks can be performed by the manufacturer or be delegated throughout the channel. These tasks can include:
- making contact with potential buyers
- negotiating
- contracting
- transferring title
- communicating
- arranging financing
- servicing the product
- providing local inventory, transportation, and storage
## Direct Channels
[[Direct channels]] are channels where manufacturer must perform all the marketing function needed to make and deliver products. A direct sales force is best used for the most complex sales opportunities, such as those that are highly customized, have large customers, and have complex products.

Direct channels are feasible when
- customers are large and well-defined
- customers insist on directing sales
- sales involve extensive negotiations with upper management
- selling has to be controlled to 
	- ensure that total product package is properly implemented
	- guarantee a quick response to market conditions
## Indirect Channels
[[Indirect channels]] are channels in which some type of intermediary (such as a distributor or dealer) sells or handles the products.

Indirect distribution is generally found where:
- markets are fragmented and widely dispersed
- low transaction amounts are prevalent
- buyers purchase a number of different items, often different brands, in one transaction

## Distributors
[[Distributors]] are full-service intermediaries. They take title to the products they sell, and they perform the full range of marketing functions. Some of the more important functions are providing credit, offering wide product assortments, delivering goods, offering technical advice, and meeting emergency requirements. Distributors are the most pervasive and are heavily used for maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) supplies. Large distributors achieve operating economies by automating the operations to significantly reduce the sales and general administrative expenses.

Distributors employ both inside and outside salespersons
- Inside salespersons take telephone orders, preocessing orders, and schedule deliveries
- Outside salespersons make regular calls on customers and handle normal account servicing and technical assistance

Services provided by distributors include
- supply chain and inventory management
- automatic replenishment
- product assembly
- in plant stores
- design services
## Classification of Distributors
There are 3 types of distributors. [[General-Line Distributors]], Specialists, and [[Combination House]] distributors. Choosing a distributor depends on the manufacturer's requirements and the needs of target customer segments. General-line distributors offer the advantages of one-stop purchasing. Specialists provide the manufacturer with a high level of technical capability and a well-developed understanding of complex customer requirements. 
## Manufacturer's Representatives
[[Manufacturer's Representatives]] are the only cost-effective answer for many business marketers who need a strong selling job with a technically strong product. They sell noncompeting but complimentary products and have expert product knowledge combined with a keen understanding of the markets and customer needs. They also give the business marketer more control as the firm maintains title and possession of the goods. Reps offer technical advice while enhancing the customer's leverage with suppliers and are paid a commission on sales they make.

Manufacturing Representatives are needed:
- in small, medium, and large sized firms
- in conditions of limited market potential
- to service distributors when a manufacturer sells through hundreds of distributors
- to reduce overhead costs

Reps act as a manufacturer's selling arm by
- making contact with customers
- writing and following up on orders
- linking the manufacturer with the industrial end users
# Channel Design
[[Channel design]] is the dynamic process of developing new channels where none existed and modifying existing channels. This can be best conceptualized as a series of stages that the business marketing manager must complete, and it specifies the structure that provides the highest probability of achieving the firm's objectives. 

Focuses on channel structure
- number of channel levels
- number and types of intermediates
- linkages among channel members

# Channel Administration
[[Channel administration]] is the process of selecting good channel participants and making sure that all tasks and obligations are assigned and understood. It involves motivating members to perform tasks necessary to achieve channel objectives, control inter-channel conflict, and control and evaluate performance.

Selecting channel members is an ongoing process that takes place through one of the following options:
1. Discussions with company salespeople and existing or potential customers
2. Trade Sources

## Motivating Channel Members
Motivating channel members starts with the understanding that the channel relationship is a partnership. That includes developing a trusting relationship with the reps, improving communication through recognition programs, product training, and consultation, informing the reps of plans, detailing objectives, and providing positive feedback, and specifying the cooperative efforts each firm requires of its partner.

You always want to minimize conflict. You can do that by
- using channel wide committees
- joint goal setting
- cooperative programs involving a number of marketing strategy elements
- effectively cooperating within the channel

By far the best way to motivate channel members is through trust and commitment. Some ways you can do that include
- offering benefits and resources that are superior to what other partners could offer
- aligning oneself with other firms that have similar corporate values
- sharing valuable information on expectations, markets, and performance
- refraining from taking advantage of one's partners
