# Managing the Sales Force
Sales management refers to planning, organizing, directing, and controlling personal selling efforts.Decisions are tempered by overall marketing objectives and must be integrated with the other elements of the marketing mix.

Personal selling is a dominant component and a major determinant of overall company success. Compared to consumers, there aren't as many potential business customers in B2B and dollar purchases tend to be large.

4 strategic components of sales force management:
1. leveraging social media
2. methods of organizing the sales force
3. key account management
4. distinctive characteristics of high-performing account managers

## Leveraging Social Media
The new customer decision journey in the business market increasingly includes digital and social media channels that decision makers use to self-diagnose their problems and form opinions about solutions. In fact, most of the decision journey has been completed before customers have made any contact with any sales representatives.
### Prospecting
Prospecting is the process of scouting for potential customers by sending short messages and locating people with an interest in the salesperson's ideas in a social environment.

Return on cold sales calls is dropping every year. One survey found that 90% of C-level executives "never" respond to cold calls or email blasts. Instead, more and more data has found that potential customers are much more responsive to short messages sent through social media.
### Qualifying Leads
IBM's famous guide to qualifying sales opportunities is BANT:
- Budget
- Authority
- Need
- Timeline

Sales representatives must determine that the prospects have the necessary *budget*, that their contact has the appropriate *authority* to buy, that there's a legitimate *need* for the product or service, and that the sales rep's *timeline* for delivery meets the customer's expectations
### Managing Relationships
Social tools are valuable for maintaining strong customer relationship ties and insuring retention after the sales cycle is complete. Developing in-depth customer knowledge is the fastest way to secure a position for a long-term collaboration. To maintain connections that last, a sales rep should make frequent social contact and offer clients valuable information on relevant issues.
## Personal Selling
A salesperson who is engaged in personal selling acts as a link between the marketplace and specific customers. To be more effective and efficient, personal selling needs to be carefully managed and integrated into the marketing mix, and the salesperson should have a wide array of knowledge about their products as well as that of competitors.
### Geographical Organization
The most common form of sales organization. Each salesperson sells all the firm's products in a defined geographical area. This reduces travel distance and time between customers, thus also minimizing costs. 

The biggest downside to this is that each salesperson must be able to perform every selling task for all of the firm's products and for all customers in the territory, which can be difficult if the products have diverse applications. The salesperson might not know about all the products or the ones that need to be emphasized for each territory.
### Product Organization
In this form, salespersons specialize in relatively narrow components of the total product line. This is great if a product line is large, diverse, or technically complex, and is great when a customer needs a salesperson with a high degree of application knowledge to meet customer needs.

However, this can be expensive and sometimes confusing for customers because the cost of training a specialized sales force this way is high, which means that a product needs to generate enough value for both you and the customer in order to justify that cost.
### Market-Centered Organization
In this form of organization, salespeople organize personal selling effort by customer type. By learning the specific requirements of a particular industry or customer type, the salesperson is better prepared to identify and respond to buying influentials of customers. For this to work however, the market segments need to be sufficiently large to warrant specialized treatment.
## Key Account Management
Many firms find that about 20% of their customer base makes up about 80% of the business. 
### Unique Value Propositions
Customer prioritization is the degree to which firms prioritize customers by developing different value propositions for its top-tier versus bottom-tier customers. Studies show that *customer prioritization* leads to higher average customer profitability and a higher return on sales by:
- positively affecting sales and profits from top-tier customers without affecting bottom-tier customers
- reducing sales and marketing costs
### Key Accounts
A key account represents a customer who:
- purchases a significant volume as a percentage of sales
- involves several organizational members in the purchasing decision
- buys for a geographically dispersed unit
- expects coordinated response and specialized services
## Key Account Success
Research suggests that successful key account units have:
- senior management support
- well-defined objectives, assignments, and implementation procedures
- experienced staff who are knowledgeable about the company's capabilities
- staff who know how to create customer solutions

Companies who have great key account management programs tend to have enhanced profitability.

# Sales Administration
Successful sales force administration involves recruiting and selecting salespersons, then training, motivating, supervising, evaluating, and controlling them.
## Recruitment, Selection, and Training of Salespersons
First-line supervisors in a company are responsible for recruiting and selecting salespersons. Periodic training needs to be provided to update skills of experienced workers. For a sales training program to work better, it should provide knowledge about the company, product line, customer segments, and competition.
## Supervision and Motivation
The sales force must be directed in a way that is consistent with the company's policies and marketing objectives. Important supervisory are continued training, counseling, assistance, and activities that help sales personnel plan and execute their work. Supervision also sets sales performance standards, fulfills company policy, and integrates the sales force with higher organizational levels.

One definition for motivation is the amount of effort someone "desires to expend on each of the activities or tasks associated with his/her job, such as calling on potential new accounts, planning sales presentations, and filling out reports." 

Motivation is strongly related to the individual's perceptions of the types and amounts of rewards from various degrees of job performance and the value the salesperson places on these rewards. There are two types of rewards that can be offered to increase motivation:
- **Internally Mediated Rewards**: Rewards attained on a personal basis
- **Externally Mediated Rewards:** Rewards controlled and offered by managers or customers
## Evaluation and Control
An ongoing sales management responsibility is to monitor and control the industrial sales force at all levels - national, regional, and district. Managers also need to determine if objectives are being achieved, identify problems and recommend corrective action, and keep salespeople informed about internal and external changes.
### Performance Measures
Measures used by sales managers
#### Behavior Based
Sales manager monitors and directs activities. Uses subjective measure to evaluate performance and adopts a compensation system with a large fixed component.
#### Outcome Based
Involves less direct supervision of salesperson
### Performance Standards
- Compare the performance of salespersons of sales units
- Determine the overall productivity of the organization
- Managerial experience and judgement help in setting appropriate standards
	- standards consider sales territories
		- vary based on aggressiveness of competitors, level of market potential, and workload.

# Deployment Analysis
Proper deployment requires a multistage approach to find the most effective and efficient way to assign sales resources across all of the [[planning and control units (PCUs)]] the firm serves.
## Territory Sales Response
There are 3 sales territory traits that deserve particular attention in sales response studies:
1. **Potential**: Measure of total business opportunity for all sellers in a particular market.
2. **Concentration**: Degree to which potential is confined to a few larger accounts in a territory.
3. **Dispersed**: Sales decrease due to time wasted in travel.

A few determinants of territory sales responses include:
- environmental factors
- competition
- company marketing strategy and tactics
- sales force organization, policies, and procedures
- field sales manager characteristics
- salesperson characteristics
- territory characteristics
