Every company has its own unique corporate culture. **Corporate culture** is the shared values, ingrained attitudes, and company traditions that determine norms of behavior, accepted work practices, and styles of operating. They shape the company's internal work climate and influences the firm's actions and approaches to conducting business.
# Key Features of a Company's Corporate Culture
A company's corporate culture is mirrored in the character or "personality" of its work environment. The main things to look for are
- values, principles, and ethical standards in actual use
- management practices and organizational policies
- atmosphere and spirit embodied in the firm's work climate
- how managers and employees interact and relate to one another
- strength of peer pressure to conform and observe norms
- actions and behaviors encouraged and rewarded
- traditions and stories and "how we do things around here"
- how the firm treats its stakeholders

The values, beliefs, and practices that undergird a company's culture can come from anywhere in the organizational hierarchy.
## The role of core values and ethics
The foundation of a company's corporate culture nearly always resides in its dedication to certain core values and the bar it sets for ethical behavior. A company's stated core values and ethical principles aim to:
- foster a work climate where company personnel share common and strongly held convictions about how the company's business is to be conducted
- provide company personnel with guidance about how to do their jobs - steering them toward both dong things right and doing the right thing
## Embedding cultural norms
Once values and ethical standards have been formally adopted, they must be institutionalized in the company's policies and practices and embedded in the conduct of company personnel. Most companies employ a variety of techniques, drawing on some or all of the following:
1. Screening applicants and hiring those who will mesh will with the culture
2. Incorporate discussions of the firm's culture and behavioral norms into orientation programs for new employees and training courses for managers and employees
3. Have senior executives frequently reiterate the importance and role of company values and ethical principles at company events and in internal communications to employees
4. Expect managers at all levels to be cultural role models and exhibit the advocated cultural norms in their own behavior.
5. Make the display of cultural norms a factor in evaluating each person'a job performance, granting compensation increases, and deciding who to promote.
6. Stress that line managers all the way down to first-level supervisors give ongoing attention to explaining the desired cultural traits and behaviors in their areas and clarifying why they are important
7. Encourage company personnel to exert peer pressure on co-workers to conform to expected cultural norms
8. Hold periodic ceremonies to honor people who excel in displaying the company values and ethical principles

# Strong vs. Weak Cultures
In a **strong-culture company**, deeply rooted values and norms of behavior are widely shared and regulate the conduct of the company's business. This type of company insists that its values and principles be reflected in the decisions and actions taken by all company personnel. Because of this, they provide a great deal of help in executing strategy

In a weak-culture company, there is a lack of widely shared and strongly held values, principles, and behavioral norms. They have few or no traditions, beliefs, values, common bonds, or behavioral norms. As a result, they provide little or not assistance in executing strategy.

# Why Corporate Cultures Matter to the Strategy Execution Process
Even if a company has a strong culture, the culture and internal work climate may or may not be compatible with what is needed for effective execution of the chosen strategy. A culture that is grounded in actions, behaviors, and work practices that are conductive to good strategy implementation supports the strategy execution effort in 3 ways:
1. A culture that is well matched to the chosen strategy and the requirements of the strategy execution effort focuses the attention of employees on what is most important to this effort.
2. Culture-induced peer pressure further induces personnel to do things in a manner that aids the cause of good strategy execution.
3. A culture that is consistent with the requirements for good strategy execution can energize employees, deepen their commitment to execute the strategy flawlessly, and enhance worker productivity.

# Healthy Cultures That Aid Good Strategy Execution
A strong culture, provided it fits the chosen strategy and embraces execution-supportive attitudes, behaviors, and work practices, is definitely a healthy culture. Two other types of cultures that tend to be healthy and support good strategy execution are:
- High Performance Cultures
- Adaptive Cultures
## High Performance Culture
Culture in which a "can-do" spirit, pride in doing things right, no-excuses accountability, and a pervasive results-oriented work climate in which people go all out to meet or beat stretch objectives. In other words, high-performance cultures have a strong commitment to achieving stretch objectives and accountability.
## Adaptive Culture
A culture where there is willingness on the part of organization members to accept change and take on the challenge of introducing and executing new strategies.

# Unhealthy Cultures That Impede Good Strategy Execution
The distinctive characteristic of an unhealthy corporate culture is the presence of counterproductive cultural traits that adversely impact the internal work climate and company performance. 5 unhealthy traits include: 
- hostility to change
- heavily politicized decision-making
- insular thinking
	- personnel start to thing they have all the answers because they've been successful for so long
- unethical and greed-driven behaviors
- presence of incompatible, clashing subcultures

# Changing a Problem Culture
When a culture is unhealthy or otherwise out of sync with the actions and behaviors needed to execute the strategy successfully, the culture must be changed as rapidly as can be managed. Changing a problem culture can be really difficult because of the heavy anchor of ingrained behaviors and attitudes.

Competent leadership at the top is necessary for culture-change efforts to be successful. In order to sell the changes, leadership needs to:
- explain why and how certain behavioral norms and work practices are obstacles to good execution of strategic initiatives
- explain how new behaviors and work practices will produce better results
- cite reasons as to why the current strategy has to be changed, if the need for cultural change is due to a change in strategy

## Substantive Culture Changing Actions
- Replace key executives who are resisting the needed organizational and cultural changes
- Promote individuals who advocate for cultural shifts and can serve as a role model for the cultural behavior
- Appoint outsiders with the desired cultural attributes to high-profile positions
- Screening all candidates for positions carefully, hiring only those who appear to fit with the new culture
- Mandate that all personnel attend culture-training
- Design compensation incentives that boost the pay of teams and individuals
- Revise policies and procedures to drive change
## How long does it take to change a problem culture?
Changing a problem culture is never a short term exercise. It always takes time and effort. A sustained and persistent effort to reinforce the culture at every opportunity through word and deed is required. It takes time for a new culture to emerge and prevail; it takes even longer for it to become deeply embedded. Fixing a problem culture and instilling a new set of attitudes and behaviors can take **two to five years**.

# Management by Walking Around (MBWA)
Management by walking around (MBWA) is one of the techniques that effective leaders use to stay informed about how well the strategy execution process is progressing. 

MBWA is used by leaders to stay informed about how well the strategy execution process is progressing, and involves spending time with people at company facilities, asking questions, listening to their opinions and concerns, and gathering firsthand information about how well aspects of the strategy execution process are going

# Closing Thoughts On Leading the Process of Crafting & Executing Strategy
It is difficult to separate leading the process of executing strategy from leading the strategy process.

Crafting, implementing, and executing strategy is a continuous process that requires much adjusting and fine-tuning of the strategy to fit changing circumstances.

The tests of strategic leadership are whether the firm has a good strategy and business model, whether its strategy is competently executed, and whether the firm is achieving its performance targets.

If these three conditions exist, then the firm has good strategic leadership and is a well-managed enterprise.
