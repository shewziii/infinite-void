# The Pricing Process in Business Markets
All pricing strategies demonstrate 3 principles:
1. Value-Based
2. Proactive
3. Profit-Driven

Value-based pricing reflects a clear understanding of how a firm's products or services create value for customers. Proactive pricing anticipates disruptive events that could happen in the future. Profit-driven pricing judges success based on bottom-line performance, rather than the level of revenue generated.
## Price Objectives
Setting pricing objectives helps in making pricing decisions. Principal pricing objectives and collateral pricing goals of the marketer are: 
- achieving target return on investment
- achieving market-share goal
- meeting competition

Other objectives include competition, channel relationships, and product-line considerations. 
## Demand Determinants
There are many things that determine the demand of a product or service which includes, usage and importance of the product/service by various market segments, potential demand, price sensitivity, potential profitability, and assessing the value place by a customer on a product.
## Differentiating Through Value Creation
Core Differentiators
- Service support
- Personal interactions
- Suppliers know-how
- Ability to improve customer's time to market

Moderate Differentiators
- Product Quality
- Delivery
- Acquisition and operation costs
## Capturing Value
How organizational buyers evaluate the economic value of the total offering determines the appropriateness of a pricing strategy. [[Economic value]] represents cost saving and/or revenue gains when purchasing a product (instead of the next best alternative). [[Commodity value]] is value that customers assign to features that resemble competitive offerings.[[Differentiation value]] represents the value of features that are unique and different from that of the competitor's.
# Identifying Value Drivers
[[Cost drivers]] create value by providing economic savings, and [[revenue drivers]] add incremental value by facilitating revenue or margin requirements.
## Elasticity Varies by Market Segment
Price elasticity measures how sensitive customers are to price changes. [[Price elasticity of demand]] is the rate of percentage change in quantity demanded to percentage change in price.

Things that can influence price elasticity of demand include:
- flexibility of customers in comparing alternatives and switching suppliers
	- satisfied customers are less price sensitive
- importance of the product in the cost structure of the customer's product
- value that a product represents to a customer
- switching costs
- end market focus
	- since demand for industrial products is derived from the demand for the product of which they are a part, strong end user focus is needed
## Cost Determinants
[[Direct traceable or attributable costs]] are fixed or variable costs that are solely incurred for a particular product, territory, or customer (e.g., raw materials). [[Indirect traceable costs]] are fixed or variable costs that can be traced to a particular product, customer, or territory (e.g., general plant overhead). [[General costs]] are costs that support a number of activities not directly related to a particular product (e.g., administrative overhead).
## Competition
Establishes an upper limit on price. Price is only one component of the cost/benefit equation. Other factors that help gain a differential advantage over competitors other than price are:
- Reputation
- Technical expertise
- Delivery reliability
# Pricing Across the Product Life Cycle
What price should be assigned to a distinctly new industrial product or service? When an item is added to an existing product line, how should it be priced in relation to products already on the line?
## Pricing New Products
Establishing the correct launch price of a product or service can reset market price expectations and boost the profit trajectory across the remainder of that offering's life cycle.

[[Skimming]] is a pricing approach where a high initial price is charged, which provides the firm with the opportunity to profitably reach market segments that are not sensitive to high initial prices. This approach is appropriate for distinctly new products and enables the marketer to capture early profits and gives the innovator a chance to recover high research and development costs more quickly. Eventually the marketer can reduce price to target more price sensitive segments.

[[Penetration]] pricing is when you charge a very low initial price, and is appropriate when there is a high price elasticity of demand, strong threat of imminent competition, and an opportunity for a substantial production cost reduction as volume expands.
