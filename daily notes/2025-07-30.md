## Tasks
- [x] Reorganize room
- [x] Draw line art character without reference

## Notes
**11:35**
	I spent a good amount of time reorganizing and dusting my room. It feels so much better in here and i feel like i have a lot more space. After that I sat down to draw. I wanted to try trusting myself with drawing a character and his hair without any reference to see what i need to improve upon. The facial proportions weren't great, and my eyes and mouth need work, but I was happy with how the hair turned out without reference. I also used the drawing tablet and I'm getting used to it.
**11:48**
	I haven't drawn in my sketchbook yet, so I'll do that now. I think I'll use the sketchbook to draw at least one thing every day so I can track my progress. Right now I'm kinda just drawing floating heads with maybe a neck, so I need to keep progressing. I will see what I need to work on more tomorrow. I don't want to stay stuck in one area or get overwhelmed by trying to do too many things at a time.
