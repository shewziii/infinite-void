# Empire of the Vampire
Started listening to the book on Audible. I'm loving the commentary on God at the beginning. 
> "Ask me not if God exists, but why he's such a prick"

I'm liking Gabriel's backstory right now. I like the whole "your father hates you because you remind him of himself" trope. It's tragic and is great exposition for who Gabriel is and what he's like.
