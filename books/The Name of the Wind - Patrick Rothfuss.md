# The Name of the Wind
> “Why? Because pride is a strange thing, and because generosity deserves generosity in return. But mostly because it felt like the right thing to do, and that is reason enough.”

Kvothe says this after the shoemaker gives him the used shoes for free. I just liked the way Rothfuss talks about pride and generosity. 

Trapis is awesome. Even when Kvothe looked almost completely different, he had no trouble recognizing him. He cares about every single kid he's taking care of. He makes sure that only one kid takes their share and doesn't hesitate to help out someone who needs it, like the kid with the hurt leg. When Kvothe told Trapis he was leaving, there was no doubt in his mind that Kvothe would do well for himself, but also makes sure he knows that he is always welcome back if he needs it.
