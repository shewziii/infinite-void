 I’d just sat down with my coffee to start brainstorming ideas for my next blog post. I opened my laptop, started up Word, and began researching my next topic.

*DINGGGG*

I looked over at my phone and saw that I’d just received an email. Raising the phone to read, I wondered who had sent it, since I only have notifications turned on for my contact email. A quick glance told me all I needed to know, and as I swiped the email to send to trash, I rolled my eyes.

I hate getting cold emails. Not because of what they are, mind you. I hate receiving them because 9 times out of 10, they suck. I’ve seen it all, from the same email template used over and over from different senders to the obvious carelessness someone put into their business that led them to neglect changing the template tags:

- *Dear [client name]*
- *I really like how [business name] does things!*
- *I hope we can get in touch soon, [client name]!*

It’s kind of embarrassing. And in this age of AI and automation, it’s even worse.

But I’m not here to complain about bad email etiquette, or the use of AI. I want to help you so that your emails and messages don’t cause somebody to roll their eyes and send them to trash. To do that, we’ll look at an email a former client of mine—we’ll call him Josh—was sending before working with me:

![Josh's original email](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/joshOriginal.png)

Josh is a talented videographer, and he wanted to send this to a local real estate agency for a shoot. The problem was that he wasn’t confident enough to offer a specific service. He wanted to be as broad as possible to get as much work as he could. Hence this bland, generic email. To make matters worse, he was sending this same email to everyone he reached out to. Everyone.

Wanna know his biggest complaint? He said that he was reaching out to hundreds of businesses, with this email, and, more often than not, all he got was crickets. So, I decided to help him. I’ll go through everything wrong with this email and talk about what we changed so that I can—hopefully—help you too.

## Do Your Homework!
It doesn’t matter if you’re going to send an email, send a dm, or call a business to pitch your services. You need to do your homework. That is, you need to do your research and figure out who you’re contacting, what they sell, who their customers are, and who their competitors are. It doesn’t need to be a complete audit with personas and a competitive analysis. A good message is a personal one.

Sounds obvious right? Unfortunately, a lot of people seem to skip this step. They look up “cold email templates” or use ChatGPT to generate a “one size fits all” email and call it a day.

The problem with that is it’s not personal. Imagine you work at the real estate agency Josh was sending the email to, and he sends you an unorganized portfolio filled mostly with wedding videos. Would you take the time to look for the real-estate projects? Most people wouldn’t.

## Don’t Skimp Out on the Subject Line
Now that you’ve (hopefully) done your research, it’s time to start writing your message. The subject line is important because it’s what gets people to actually open your email. Don’t underestimate its importance.

Let’s look at our example:

![Josh's original subject line](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/joshSubjectLine.png)

When you see those two words in your inbox from somebody you don’t know, what do you think? Need help? Help with what? I’m good, I think.

*Delete*

This subject line is bland, doesn’t tell you anything, and doesn’t really catch anyone’s attention. What could Josh have done instead? Think back to the research you did. What would this prospect respond to? Your subject line should be personal, descriptive, and short, depending on who you’re contacting.

![Revised subject line](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/subjectLineRevised.png)

This subject line and the accompanying preheader is what we decided to go with. The emoji is used to catch the attention of the prospect in the inbox. The reference to the area they’re doing business in and the call to attention of the competitive landscape are meant to give the subject line a bit of personalization. It’s also short, it tell you what the email is about, and it’s interesting.

## The Opening Line
Now that you’ve got your receiver to open your email—or you’ve skipped the subject line If you’re sending a message through another medium—it’s time for them to start reading. Your opening line needs to bring them in. This is your hook. Once again, it should show that you did your research on who and what the receiver is. Let’s look at Josh’s first line:

![Josh's original opening line](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/joshOpeningLine.png)

This is weak for a few reasons. First, it’s not specific, which means it isn’t personalized, which means it’s not interesting. Phrases like “I hope this email finds you well” and “I’m reaching out because” make the email feel template and ingenuine and will cause the reader to click off. The third line also doesn’t provide any value. *I found your business online* doesn’t really mean much, especially if the business has a website, which is the case for almost every business today. Of course you found it online. Lastly, *I thought you could use some help*. Again, help with what?

Delete

What could he have done instead? Here’s what we did:

> I noticed that a lot of listings on your website were missing video tours. Did you know that real estate agencies who utilize virtual and video tours sell better and are up to 30% faster at closing than those who don’t?

Opening with an observation and calling out a problem that demonstrates you did your homework is a great way to get them interested right away. It shows that you cared enough to learn about business, it shows that you understand the industry, and you’re pointing out an opportunity they may not have thought about in the past. There’s a lot of different strategies for writing opening lines to get into, but for now, let’s get into the body of your message.

## Focus On the Benefits
Now it’s time to sell yourself. Once you have their attention and they’ve already decided to hear you out, it’s time to tell them what you can do for them. Your body needs to tell a story and show prospects what you can offer them—and not what they can do for you.

![Josh's email body](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/joshBody.png)

The biggest issue here is that it sounds way too “sales professional.” It sounds like he’s trying to sell and make money from you. Of course, that was the end goal, but pitches like these have a tendency to turn the reader away from continuing. It’s also way too generic as I’ve mentioned earlier. It also doesn’t actually say anything about how Josh can help, what he does, and it looks like he didn’t do any research. It’s very obviously a template.

Now, count the amount of time he uses the word “you” and then count how many times he said “I”. It’s a pretty significant difference. No matter who you’re pitching to, on whatever platform, to whatever industry, you should be focusing on them, not yourself. As a reader, it feels like the writer only cares about themselves.

Here’s what we came up with instead:

> My name is Josh. Video tours could be a great opportunity to showcase your properties, give potential customers more flexibility to view listings, and help you close sales faster. I’d love to meet with you to go through some ideas and take a look at some of the previous projects I’ve worked on.

This pitch is a lot more specific. Now the prospect knows who you are, what you do, and most importantly, it focuses on what you can do for them.

## Get Them to Follow Through
CTA’s (Calls to Action) are an art of their own. They’re important on websites, they’re important in social media, and they’re important in emails. You’ve already got your message down. They’ve opened your email; they’ve read through and are interested in working with you. But they end up closing the email because they have nothing more to do. “I’ll respond tomorrow” they think. You need to get them to act now.

![Josh's original CTA](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/joshCTA.png)

This call to action is weak. The line, “is this something you would be interested in?” doesn’t really give the prospect anything to work with. If they’re interested, they’ll contact you, and if not, they’ll either say so, or won’t respond at all, regardless of whether you ask them or not.

The second line is almost there. Its biggest drawback comes from being nonspecific. It gives the prospect permission to respond at their own leisure, which may be never. A good CTA is specific and creates a sense of urgency.

> Let’s set up a call to talk more about this project for next week. Does Monday work for you?

That’s more like it. This is a lot more specific. It gives the prospect a reason to respond. Maybe Monday is busy for them, and they think a different time would work better. They’ll let you know. Maybe Monday is perfect and they want to get a specific time. They’ll let you know. Whatever the case, they now have a reason to respond right away.

Let’s take a look at the end product:

![Full revised email](../../assets/blog/coldEmails/fullRevisedEmail.png)

What do you think? Is this better than Josh’s original template? The agency did end up responding, but unfortunately, they weren’t interested after their call. However, Josh ended up talking to the owner and they ended up talking regularly which led to him to other opportunities that he took advantage of.

Cold outreach, while not the most effective way to get hired, can create opportunities when done right. When you successfully get somebody to respond, it can open doors for you. Even if they end up saying “not interested,” you can still ask to keep in touch or ask them to connect you with somebody else to build your network, which is one of the most valuable assets you can have.

## Quick Recap
Cold outreach still works in 2026. I just want to make sure you’re doing it right:

**Do Your Homework**

Research who you’re reaching out to, what they do, and what problems they have. A personalized message will get you more responses than a generic template.

**Don’t Skimp Out on the Subject Line**

The subject line is meant to get people to open your message. If it isn’t interesting, they won’t open your message.

**Write a Compelling Opening Line**

The opening line is used to get people to start reading. Tell a story, give an observation, or give them data to demonstrate industry knowledge.

**Give Benefits**

In your body, benefits should be the main content. You want to describe ways you can help them, and not how they can help you.

**Give them a Call to Action**

Give them something actionable to do. Tell them to give you a call on a specific day, give them a link to schedule a date. Give them something to do right away so they don’t forget to reply.
