**ON SCREEN: DARK SCREEN - DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES IN**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** The Finiverse. A discord community meant to bring video editors together to discuss ideas and get help, feedback, and make friends. 

**ON SCREEN: SCREENSHOTS OF THE FINIVERSE SERVER**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Video editors, content creators, script writers, and thumbnail artists from around the world come to Finiverse in hopes of finding their next "job".

**ON SCREEN: SCREENSHOTS OF TERRIBLE JOB BOARD OFFERS AND DESPERATE MEMBERS ACCEPTING THEM**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Editors who have only been editing since last week, editors who have nothing to show in their portfolios, and editors who *just want their money now* seek access to the fabled job board.

**ON SCREEN: JOB-NOTICE INFORMATION FOR GAINING ACCESS THROUGH PATREON**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** To gain access to the legendary channel that has changed many lives for the better, a generous sum of $4.50 must be paid to Finzar's patreon. As you can imagine, this steep price would be the subject of anger for many members. Fortunately, there is another option. 

**ON SCREEN: JOB-NOTICE INFORMATION FOR LEVELING SYSTEM**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Finiverse, like many servers, has a leveling system used to determine which members are allowed to post images, gifs, and be treated with general respect.

**ON SCREEN: ROLES-DETAILS**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** When members join the server, they start out as the infamous red jumper jumper role. RJ for short. These members are the least experienced, but often demand the most. Disgusting. However, those who act decently and don't end up getting banned withing their first week may find themselves turning orange, then yellow. 

**ON SCREEN: ORANGE AND YELLOW MEMBERS BEING WEIRD**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** These new members can now send images and gifs and interact with other members as humans. Some may have even made friends along the way. But for those who are truly overzealous and hungry, or for those who *need* to feed their families and pay their rent, one role marks *true success* as an editor:

**ON SCREEN: FADE TO BLACK THEN SHOW LVL 3 INFORMATION WITH MUSIC SWELLS**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Level 3.

**ON SCREEN: FAST CUTS TO MEMBERS BECOMING LEVEL 3 - HIGH ENERGY MUSIC**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Members turn green and gain access to the great job board! They rush to the channel to see what opportunities lie ahead of them, ready for the taking. Weeks of spewing nonsense, bothering other members, and being spat on by level 3s, 4s, and 5s finally pay off. You've made it.

**ON SCREEN: FADE TO BLACK - MUSIC FADES TO SILENCE**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** This cycle was not new. Member after member joined and left. Unchanging. Predictable.

**ON SCREEN: FADE IN TO SILHOUETTE OF BURHAN'S PFP** 
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Until [Burhan Slasher join date], when a certain member joined the server. Nobody knew the lengths he would go to reach level 3.

**ON SCREEN: FAST CUTS TO MEMBERS SAYING HIS NAME AND DIFFERENT CHATS WITH HIM IN IT**

**NARRATOR (V.O.)** Burhan Slasher was an enigma. Coming in guns blazing, just ready to take on the Finiverse. 

INT. INTERVIEW SNIPPETS FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS

(waiting on interview)

ORION
Yeah I'm admin of the server. I had no idea who this guy was.

**ON SCREEN: BURHAN'S PFP AND DIFFERENT CONTEXTS OF HIM MENTIONING THE GRIND**
**NARRATOR (V.O.)** His commitment to the server and dedication to grinding xp like a runescape account was legendary. Replying to anything and everything, and always giving his staunch opinions, Burhan Slasher's reputation grew quickly as he squeezed every last bit of xp from conversation every chance he got. He was praised for his undying resolve.
