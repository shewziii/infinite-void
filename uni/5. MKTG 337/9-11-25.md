Load the customer with mats. The more mats the better, but at a reasonable level
- Front entrances
- Around the soda fountains
- Around any produce
- Counter spaces

Goal is to keep a clean a facility for customers

86% of adults have negative perception on retail, and 68% of those would not return
takes 1500 people to remove 42% of the finish of a floor, and its a lot more expensive to finish a floor vs signing up for a mat service

**Look up stats of accident rates of stores that have mats vs not**

- Mats bubble in the cleaning process because cloth and fiber shrink. Phoenix fiber does not shrink in the washing process
- Takes 15-20 minutes to swap out mats in one location
