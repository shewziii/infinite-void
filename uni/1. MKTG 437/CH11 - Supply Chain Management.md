# Supply Chain Management
>[!info] Supply Chain Management

[[Supply Chain Management]] is a technique for linking a manufacturer's operations with those of all of its strategic suppliers and its key intermediaries and customer to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

Goals of supply chain management include waste reduction, time compression to reduce order-to-delivery cycle time, flexible response in terms of being able to adapt to order sizes, product variety, and configuration, and unit cost reduction. Firms seek to reduce waste by minimizing duplication, harmonizing operations and systems, and enhancing quality. 

The supply chain design depends on the nature of demand. [[Functional products]] have predictable demand patterns, minimize logistics and inventory costs, and assure low-cost manufacturing. [[Innovative products]] have less predictable demand patterns, react to short life cycles, avoid shortages or excess supplies, and they take advantage of high profits during peak demand periods.
# Supply Chain Partnership
Highly effective supply chains feature integrated operations across participants, share information in a timely manner, and add value for the customer. They are successful when participants can clearly define strategic objectives, understand where their objectives diverge, and when they work together to resolve differences. Once partners agree on establishing an integrated supply chain, performance metrics can be established to track its goals

Metrics must measure performance and are tied to a financial system that rewards the system
# Risk Management in the Supply Chain
- Analyze and monitor risk exposure
- Diversify supply forces
- Reevaluate "make versus" buy decisions
- Build stronger supplier relationships
- Share real-time information with supply chain partners
- Perform regular stress tests of the supply chain
# Logistics Management
Coordinates and optimizes all logistics activities. Integrates logistics activities with other functions including marketing, sales, etc.

The difference between logistics and SCM (Supply Chain Management) is that SCM focuses on the integration of all business processes that add value for customers
