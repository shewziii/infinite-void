# Supply Chain Management
[[Supply Chain Management]] is a technique for linking a manufacturer's operations with those of all of its strategic suppliers and its key intermediaries and customer to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

Goals of supply chain management include waste reduction, time compression to reduce order-to-delivery cycle time, flexible response in terms of being able to adapt to order sizes, product variety, and configuration, and unit cost reduction. Firms seek to reduce waste by minimizing duplication, harmonizing operations and systems, and enhancing quality.
