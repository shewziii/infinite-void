# What is Strategy?
Strategy is a company's coordinated set of actions that its managers take in order to outperform the company's competitors and achieve superior profitability.
- What is our present situation?
- Where do we want to go from here?
- How are we going to get there?

# Competing Differently
Strategy as a choice:
- Is deciding to compete differently - pressuring rivals by doing what they do not do or, even better, doing what they cannot do.
- Provides guidance in what it must do and also what it must not do.
- Is successful when its actions, business approaches, and competitive moves appeal to buyers in ways that: 
    - Set it apart from its rivals by through higher perceived values or efficiently producing at lower costs 
    - Stake out a market position that is not crowded

# Competitive & Sustainable Competitive Advantage
Competitive Advantage:
- Requires meeting customer needs either more effectively (with products or services that customers value more highly) or more efficiently (by providing products or services at a lower cost to customers) 
Sustainable Competitive Advantage Requires:
- Giving buyers lasting reasons to prefer products or services over competitors 
- Develop expertise and long term capabilities that cannot be readily overcome
- Putting the constant quest for sustainable competitive advantage at center stage in crafting your strategy

# Strategy & the Business Model
How the firm will make money:
- By providing customers with value 
    - The firm's customer value proposition
        - The reason a customer would choose you over another company
- By generating revenues sufficient to cover costs and produce attractive profits 
    - The firm's profit formula

---
# Profit formula
Creates a cost structure that allows for acceptable profits, given that pricing is tied to the customer value proposition 
V: the value provided to customers
P: the price charged to customers
C: the firm's costs

The lower the costs (C) for a given customer value proposition (V-P), the greater the ability of the business model to be a moneymaker

# Stage 1: Developing a strategic vision, a mission statement, and a set of core values
Developing a strategic vision
- Delineates management's aspirations for the firm to its stakeholders
- Provides direction: "where are we going?"
- Sets out the compelling rationale (strategic soundness) for the firm's direction
- Uses distinctive and specific language to set the firm apart from its rivals 

# The Mission Statement 
A well-conceived company mission statement: 
- Uses specific language to give the firm its own unique identity
- Describes the firm's current business and purpose - "who we are, what we do, and why we are here"
- Should focus on describing the firm's business, not on "making a profit"

> [!note] Earning a profit is an objective, not a mission

# Mission vs. Vision
A strategic vision describes a firm's aspirations for its future (answers the questions - "where are we going")

A firm's mission depicts its purpose and its current business (answers the questions "who we are, what we do, and why we are here")

> [!note] Vision describes the future, Mission describes the now

# Core Values 
The beliefs, traits, and behavioral norms that employees are expected to display in conducting the firm's business and in pursuing its strategic vision and mission 
They become an integral part of the firm's culture and what makes it tick when strongly espoused and supported by top management
They match the firm's vision, mission, and strategy, contributing to the firm's business success
> [!note] Core values link the vision and mission

---
# Stage 2: Setting Objectives
The purpose of setting objectives:
- To convert the vision and mission into specific, measurable, challenging yet achievable, deadline performance targets 
- To focus efforts and align actions throughout the organization
- To serve as yardsticks for tracking a firm's performance and progress
- To provide motivation and inspire employees to greater levels of effort

# Converting Objectives to Performance Targets 
Characteristics of well-stated objectives:
- Quantifiable
- Specific
- Challenging 
- Deadline for achievement 

# Stretch Objectives 
Setting stretch objectives promotes better overall performance because stretch targets because they: 
- Push a firm to be more intentive
- increase the urgency for improving financial performance and competitive position
- Cause the firm to be more intentional and focused in its actions 
- Creates an exciting work environment and attract the best people
- Help prevent internal inertia and contentment with modest gains in performance 

# Balanced Scoreboard
A balanced scoreboard strives to place:
- Balanced emphasis on achieving both financial and strategic objectives by tracking measures of both financial performance and the competitiveness of its market position 
- The 4 dimensions of a Balanced scoreboard:
1. Financial objectives 
2. Strategic objectives that signal greater competitive strength (and thus greater capability to achieve higher levels of financial performance)
3. Internal process objectives relating to productivity and quality
4. Organizational objectives concerning human capital, culture, infrastructure, and innovation

Strategy making:
- Addresses a series of strategic hows 
- Requires choosing among strategic alternatives
- Promotes actions to do things differently from competitors rather than running with the herd
- Is a collaborative team effort that involves managers in various positions at all organizational levels
