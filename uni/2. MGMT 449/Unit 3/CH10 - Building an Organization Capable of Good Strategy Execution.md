# A Framework for Executing Strategy
Strategy execution is operations-driven, involving management of both people and business processes. It's a job for the whole management team rather than just a few senior managers and can take years longer to develop as a real proficiency than implementing strategy. It requires a determined commitment to change, action, and performance.
## The Principle Components of the Strategy Execution Process
Despite the need to tailor a company's strategy-executing approaches to the situation at hand, certain managerial bases must be covered no matter what the circumstances. These include 10 basic managerial tasks:
1. staffing the organization with managers and employees capable of executing the strategy well
2. developing the resources and organizational capabilities required for successful strategy execution
3. creating a strategy-supportive organizational structure
4. allocating sufficient resources (budgetary and otherwise) to the strategy execution effort
5. instituting policies and procedures that facilitate strategy execution
6. adopting business management processes that drive continuous improvement in how value chain activities are performed
7. installing information and operating systems that enable company personnel to perform essential activities
8. tying rewards directly to the achievement of performance objectives
9. fostering a corporate culture that promotes good strategy execution
10. exerting the leadership needed to propel strategy execution forward
# Building an Organization Capable of Good Strategy Execution: 3 Key Actions
Organizations that execute strategy well do three things:
1. staffing the organization
2. acquiring, developing, and strengthening key resources and organizational capabilities
3. structuring the organization and work effort
## Staffing the Organization
Putting together a strong management team, and recruiting, training, and retaining employees with the needed experience, technical skills, and intellectual capital (the human resources).
## Acquiring, Developing, and Strengthening Key Resources and Organizational Capabilities
Accumulating the required resources, developing proficiency in performing strategy-critical value chain activities, and updating the company's capabilities to match changing market conditions and customer expectations.
## Structuring the Organization and Work Effort
Organizing value chain activities and business processes, establishing lines of authority and reporting relationships, and deciding how much decision-making authority to delegate to lower-level managers and front-line employees
# Developing and Building Critical Resources and Organizational Capabilities
High among the organization-building priorities in the strategy execution process is the need to build and strengthen the company's portfolio of resources and capabilities. There are 3 approaches to this:
1. Developing Organizational Capabilities Internally
2. Acquiring Capabilities through Mergers and Acquisitions
3. Accessing Capabilities through Collaborative Partnerships
# Matching Organizational Structure to the Strategy
While there are few hard and fast rules for organizing the work effort to support good strategy execution, there is one: a firm's organizational structure should be matched to the particular requirements of implementing the firm's strategy. Some considerations in organizing the work efforts are common to all companies: 
- Decide which value chain activities to perform internally and which ones to outsource
- Align the organizational structure with the strategy
- Decide how much authority to centralize at the top and how much to delegate to down-the-line managers and employees
- Facilitate collaboration with external partners and strategic allies
## Deciding Which Value Chain Activities to Perform Internally and Which to Outsource
Outsourcing can help in outperforming rivals in strategy-critical activities and in turning a competence into a distinctive competence. It decreases bureaucracies, flattens structure, speeds up decision-making, and shortens response time to changing market conditions. Outsourcing also adds to a firm's capabilities and contributes to better strategy execution through partnerships with suppliers and channel partners
## Aligning the Firm's Organizational Structure with its Strategy
The design of  the firm's organizational structure is a critical aspect of the strategy execution process. Structure is aligned with strategy when its design contributes to the creation of value for customers, it's parts are aligned with one another and also matched to the requirements of the strategy, and it lowers operating costs through lower bureaucratic costs and operational efficiencies.

A [[simple structure]] structure in which a central executive (often the owner-manager) handles all major decisions and oversees the operations of the organization with the help of a small staff. Also called *line-and-staff structures* or *flat structures*

[[Functional structures]] are organized into functional departments, with departmental managers who report to the CEO and small corporate staff. Functional structures are also called *departmental structures* and *unitary structures* or *U-forms*.

[[Multidivisional Structures]] are decentralized structures consisting of a set of operating divisions organized along business, product, customer group, or geographic lines and a central corporate headquarters that allocates resources, provides support functions, and monitors divisional activities. These are also called *divisional structures* or *M-forms.*

A [[matrix structure]] is a combination structure that overlays one type of structure onto another type, with multiple reporting relationships. It is used to foster cross-unit collaboration. Matrix structures are also called *composite structures* or *combination structures.*
## Determining How Much Authority to Delegate
Under any organizational structure, there is room for considerable variation in how much authority top-level executives retain and how much is delegated to down-the-line managers and employees. Two extremes are [[centralized decision making]] where decision making falls at the top or [[decentralized decision making]] which gives managers and employees at all levels considerable decision-making latitude in their areas of responsibility.
## Facilitating Collaboration with External Partners and Strategic Allies
Organizational mechanisms-whether formal or informal-are also required to ensure effective working relationships with each major outside constituency involved in strategy execution. Getting managers of execution-critical activities to live up to their commitments to coordinate closely with sister organizational unit is a key factor in achieving good internal cross-unit coordination.

A [[network]] is a configuration linking a group of independent organizations engaged in some common undertaking organized by a central firm.

An [[ecosystem]] is a loose configuration of different types of organizations involved in some non-contractual mutual purpose.
