# From Benchmarking to Operations Excellence
1. Engage in benchmarking to identify the best practice for performing an activity
2. Adapt the best practice to fit the company's situation; then implement it (and further improve it over time)
3. Continue to benchmark company performance of the activity against best-in-industry or best-in-world performers
4. Move closer to operating excellence in performing the activity

The more that organizational units use best practices in performing their work, the closer a company moves toward performing its value chain activities as effectively and efficiently as possible.
