**Post 2: The AI Problem** The hook writes itself: "If everyone sounds like a thought leader, no one is." Cover how AI flooded feeds with readable but forgettable content, and that audiences can now spot it immediately. The payoff slide: originality is the only thing that cuts through now.

**Post 3: Why Your Content Strategy Is Designed to Fail** This one stings in a good way. The premise is that most strategies are built to avoid friction, not create impact. Use the four uncomfortable questions from the article as individual slides, one question per card. That format works well as a carousel stopper.

**Post 4: Candour Builds More Authority Than Wins Do** Lead with the conference analogy (sitting through an eight-hour advertisement of success stories). The contrast slide: the speaker who admits what went wrong is the one people remember. This is a strong standalone post because it challenges a common assumption about personal branding.

**Post 5: Your Leaders Are Your Differentiator** Pull the APCO stat: over three-quarters of people say a CEO's reputation directly influences their buying and investment decisions. The message is that authority lives in people, not logos. Practical closing slide: one weekly voice note from a leader beats ten polished blog posts.

**Post 6: Bold vs. Reckless (The Warning)** This is a good closer for the series. Use the real examples from the article (Tesla, MyPillow, Whole Foods) as cautionary slides. The takeaway: opinionated about your market, careful about everything else.

Each post could end with the same CTA slide to keep the series feeling cohesive. Want me to write out the actual slide copy for any of these?
