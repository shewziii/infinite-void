I was sitting down with my coffee the other morning when my phone buzzed.

Another cold email.

I rolled my eyes and sent it straight to trash.

See, cold emails don’t fail because outreach is dead, but because most of them are lazy, generic, and painfully obvious templates or AI generated messages.

This week I go over why most cold emails get ignored and what to do instead.

## 4 reasons your cold emails aren't getting responses

**1. No research**

If your message could be sent to literally anyone, it feels personal to no one. A little homework goes a long way.

**2. Weak subject lines**

“Need help?” tells me nothing. Your subject line should be specific, relevant, and give me a reason to open your email.

**3. Uninteresting Opening Lines**

“I hope this email finds you well” is a fast way to lose attention. Your opening line should prove you actually looked at their business or have knowledge about their industry. This is where a little bit of research comes in handy.

**4. Vague CTAs**

“If you’re interested, let me know” gives people permission to never reply. A good CTA gives them something actionable to do right now, or at the very least, tell you why they can't do that right away.

There's a lot more I could say about his subject, and I did. You can find more information about writing cold emails on my blog, where I break down a real example from a former client who was sending hundreds of emails and consistently heard nothing back.
