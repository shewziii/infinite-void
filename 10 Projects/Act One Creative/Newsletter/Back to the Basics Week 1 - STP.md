Hey!

This week will be the start of a new series called Back to the Basics.

The goal of this series is to serve as a bit of review for those who might need help getting started with marketing. I'll be providing you with guides, templates, and information for you to succeed with your own marketing efforts. We'll start with the fundamentals.

## STP (Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning)
STP is the strategic framework that answers three questions before you get into planning: Who could buy from you? Who should you focus on? And why should they choose you over competitors? This process is important to get right because it sets you up with a nice basis for which you can start working.

## 🗂️ Segmentation
Segmentation is about recognizing that not all customers belong to the same group. Your market is made up of different groups with different needs, behaviors, and characteristics. The goal here is to divide that broad market into smaller, manageable segments.

You can segment by geographics (physical location), demographics (age, income, gender), psychographics (values, lifestyle, interests), and behavior (purchase patterns, brand loyalty). 

The goal here is to create segments that are easy to measure and keep track of, are large enough to have a purpose, and differ from each other enough to justify being different segments.

## 🎯 Targeting
Once you have your segments, now its time to decide which one you will target.

This is where you evaluate each segment based on what's important to you and your goals, the competition, and how profitable they might be. From here there are 3 strategies you can use to approach targeting.

### Concentrated
A concentrated strategy is one where you choose a single segment to focus your efforts on. 

### Differentiated
A differentiated strategy is one in which multiple segments are chosen.

### Undifferentiated
An undifferentiated strategy is one which your approach is essentially one-size-fits-all. You don't choose any specific segments, but rather all segments.

The strategy you choose depends on your goals and the type of product or service you're selling. 

## 📌 Positioning
Positioning defines how you want your customers to view  your brand compared to others. For instance, your brand can be known as the most affordable, most convenient, highest quality, etc. These positions are differentiations regarding how you compare to other brands.

If you're a runner, you might know about different running apps. You might know Strava to be the best for tracking and community integration, and Nike Run Club as the best for beginners and having good running plans. These are examples of different positioning statements that you might see or want to aim for.

## 🤔 Why STP Matters
Without STP you're just guessing at who your customer base is and who you should target. It helps create a foundation for you to make decisions such as packaging, pricing, advertising, and messaging.

No matter what industry you're working in STP is a must,
