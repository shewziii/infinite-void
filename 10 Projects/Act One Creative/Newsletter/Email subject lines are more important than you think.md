I was scrolling through my inbox this morning. Cluttered as usual, nothing super interesting to report. I only opened 3.

It's embarrassing.

This week's blog post talks about what you can do to avoid this. In it, I give you 10 strategies for writing subject lines that get your emails opened. Things like:

- Why doing your homework is non-negotiable (and what to look for)
- How to use emojis without looking like spam
- The psychology behind asking questions and giving readers a cliffhanger
- Why being specific piques interese every time
- And how to write like a human instead of sounding like ChatGPT

## Bonus for Subscribers!
Since you're a subscriber, we'll talk about something I didn't touch on in the blog:

## Preheaders
A preheader is the bit of text immediately after—or below, depending on your email client—that gives the reader a bit more information about the contents of the email.

In this one, the preheader is the little grayed out text that reads "(Hint: It's Not Email)"
Why Preheaders Matter

Think about it like this: Your subject line is bolded, it grabs their attention, and maybe it has an emoji for more effect. The reader is still on edge, but they notice the preheader gives them a little bit of information, or makes them curious. Like the example above.

The preheader is often the little extra push readers need to open the email.

Together, you've got anywhere from 90 to 140 characters (depending on which email client someone's using) to convince them to open your email instead of the other 146 sitting in their inbox.

Gmail shows about 90 characters on desktop and Apple Mail on iPhone shows around 140. So why would you waste that space when you could
How to Write Good Preheaders

Don't repeat your subject line

If your subject line says "Your free trial expires in 3 days," don't use your preheader to say the exact same thing. Instead, you could go with

> Your free trial expires in 3 days - Here's how to upgrade and save 20% before it's too late

See the difference? The subject line creates urgency, and the preheader gives them something to act on so they don't just let the trial expire.

Add context that didn't fit in the subject line

Your subject line has limited space before it gets cut off. Use the preheader to give them a reason to care:

> 3 changes that doubled our conversion rate - And how you can implement them in under an hour

Include a soft call to action

While your subject line hooks them, your preheader can nudge them toward opening your email:

> Still sending cold emails like it's 2015? - See what's working in 2026 (and what's not)

Watch your length

Aim for 40-130 characters. Any longer and it gets cut off mid-sentence, which looks sloppy.
Quick Checklist

Here's what you should do every single time you write an email:

✓ Write your preheader at the same time as your subject line

✓ Make sure your preheader compliments your subject line

✓ Keep it under 130 characters

✓ Add new information rather than repeating the subject line

Subject lines and preheaders are your friend, so make sure you don't ignore their importance,
