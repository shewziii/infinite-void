## Buyer Personas
A buyer persona is a semi-fictional profile that represents an ideal customer. It helps you understand who you're targeting and how they behave. They take a little bit of guesswork to create, but the majority of a persona should be built on research and data.

## 🧩 What's in a Persona?
A buyer persona is made up of a few different components:

### Demographics
Age, gender, location, income, education, and employment information.

### Psychographics
Interests, values, beliefs, and lifestyle.

### Pain-points
Challenges the persona might face.

### Behavior
Preferred channels, buying behavior, purchase patterns, and purchase triggers.

These are all things you might include in a buyer persona to determine exactly who your ideal customer is and how you would be able to reach them. Additional factors such as goals could also play a role in who your customer is.

## 🔍 Building a Persona
Building a persona is relatively straightforward. It starts with—as you might expect—market research. If you've been following this series then you've probably already identified your target audience through STP. You should also be utilizing market data to find out your target segment's buying behaviors, habits, and touchpoints.

Once that's done, you can go ahead and find out what their goals are. Knowing what motivates your audience is a great starting point since it gives you an idea about what would make them want to buy from you.

The next step to building a persona is to identify their pain points. Pain points are specific problems that customers may face regularly that can cause frustration friction in the consumer journey. These can be financial challenges, they might need more specific solutions to problems, the process of making a purchase may be too complex, or they find staff unhelpful. Anything that prevents the customer from experiencing a pleasant consumer journey is a pain point.

Now that you've gathered all the necessary information, it's time to start putting together a profile. This is where a little bit of informed guesswork comes in. They key to having a good buyer persona is to humanize it. The best way to do this is to give them a name and a picture of what they might look like.

Then give them a description. The more detailed the description is, the better. Include demographic data, their job title, income, personality, interests, and more. 

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
### Making too many personas
It's tempting to create a persona for every customer you may want, but that defeats the purpose of the persona and the point of doing STP in the first place.

### Making them too vague
Persona's are become more helpful the more specific they are. *25-30 year old man who's into fitness* is not a persona.

### Treating them as permanent
Personas are not one and done. You and your customers are always changing, so it stands that the personas you create should too. Update the persona often to keep up with your ideal customer base.

## 🎯 Why Personas Matter
Personas prevent your messaging from being generic. Without them you end up trying to appeal to everyone, which—unless you're go for an undifferentiated strategy—isn't the best way approach marketing. With a persona, things like targeting, content, packaging, and messaging become easier and more effective.

No matter what stage your business is in, personas prove to be a valuable tool in target marketing,
