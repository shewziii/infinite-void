# What 5 Years of Freelance Video Editing Taught Me About Content Marketing
I'd just gotten home after a 10-hour shift at my serving job. The Saturday night dinner crowd left me utterly exhausted. The worst part of it all was I still had homework to do. So I lugged myself to my bed, opened my Microsoft Surface tablet that I was using as my laptop, and got to work.

I opened the dashboard for my graphic design class and saw that we were moving from theory to hands-on work, so I opened up Adobe Creative Cloud and looked for the software I would need for the next few weeks. While I was waiting for the apps to download, I decided to explore a little. What caught my eye were two apps that would prove to be my most valuable tools for the next 5 years: Premiere Pro and After Effects. I read through the descriptions, hit download, and made a mental note to check them out the next day.

What started as curiosity turned into a second job and hundreds of projects. I went from a clueless 18-year old watching every tutorial I could find, to getting paid to help brands and creators tell stories that in 2025, on one client's channel alone, came out to a total of almost 8 million hours of watch time.

And somewhere in those hundreds of hours of cutting, sound designing, and trying to hold people's attention, along with my time studying for my Bachelor's degree in marketing, I started noticing patterns that I have everything to do with getting people to consume. 

## Story Over Everything
We're currently living in an age of information. It's currently estimated that we as humans are assaulted with the equivalent of over 100,000 words every day. That includes watching your favorite movies, scrolling through Tik Tok, or listening to the radio on your way to work. But I bet you can't remember the last advertisement you saw.

When your senses are bombarded with hundreds of sensory messages every minute, your brain tends to filter most of it out. The same goes for the media we consume. When I was trying to figure out how I was going to get my clients' audiences to stay and continue watching a video through to the end, I learned something very important: storytelling is what gets people to watch. 

This makes sense if you think about it. When you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, or Tik Tok, you probably see a lot of content that just gives you the information you're looking for straight up. "Do These 5 Things to Increase Engagement." "You NEED to Stop Doing These 10 Things If You Want to Grow." Sound familiar? In this new growing age of generative AI, these types of posts are even more common. And I bet you scroll past almost every single one of them. 

I was working for a fitness influencer a few years back, and he had the story down. Where he struggled was his hooks. Almost every reel he made started with something along the lines of "Top 10 Exercises to Get Your Abs to POP" or "How to Lose 10 Pounds in 1 Month". What do these opening lines make your think? To me it just looks like he's going to give me a list of exercises to do and call it a day. And that's exactly what I told him. Thankfully he was open to feedback and asked me what I would change for the weight loss video. This is what I gave him based on what he told me:

> I signed up for a marathon next month, and I still felt out of shape. So my goal for the next 30 days would be to lose 10 pounds. Here's how I got myself into top running shape before that time.

See the difference?

Compared to his previous content, this video ended up not only increasing his view count, but it increased his engagement, watch time, and shares. He saw this difference and applied a similar hook to the rest of his videos moving forward, which subsequently resulted in an increase in those KPIs. 

Why did this work? 
## Gotta Have Rhythm
**Structure:**

- **Open with an editing moment** - Describe what it feels like to watch a video with bad pacing vs. good pacing. Maybe talk about how you can _feel_ when a shot lingers too long or cuts too fast, even if viewers can't articulate why they clicked away.
- **The principle** - In editing, pacing is about knowing when to slow down (let an emotional moment breathe) and when to speed up (keep energy moving). It's rhythm. Variety. Viewers need both tension and release.
- **The written media parallel** - A wall of text is like a 5-minute uncut shot - exhausting. Breaking up paragraphs, varying sentence length, using white space - that's pacing in writing. Short sentence. Then a longer one that builds on the idea and gives context. Then short again for impact.
- **Practical application** - Show them a before/after of an email or blog section. Dense paragraph vs. the same content with pacing. Or give them the rule: "Vary your sentence length. Use one-sentence paragraphs. Give the reader's eyes somewhere to rest."
## Emotion is the Engine
**Structure:**

- **Connect back to previous sections** - Story, hooks, pacing - they're all techniques. But here's what they're all serving: emotion. You can have perfect story structure and lose people if they don't _feel_ anything. You can have terrible pacing but if you hit the right emotional note, people will stay.
- **Your editing insight** - Talk about what you learned from editing emotional moments. Maybe it's that the best emotional beats come from restraint, not manipulation. Or that emotion comes from specificity - the right detail at the right moment. Or that people don't remember information, they remember how you made them feel.
- **Why this matters for marketing** - Most marketing focuses on features, benefits, logic. But people make decisions emotionally and justify them rationally later. If your content doesn't make someone feel something - curiosity, frustration, hope, recognition - it doesn't matter how well-structured it is.
- **The application** - Before writing anything, ask: "What do I want them to feel?" Not think. Feel. Then reverse-engineer your story, hook, and pacing to create that emotion.
- **End with a callback** - Maybe circle back to that exhausted college kid downloading Premiere Pro, or the 8 million watch hours. Tie it together emotionally so the post itself demonstrates what you're teaching.
