# What 5 Years of Video Editing Taught Me About Making Content People Actually Want to See

9 Min Read | Published: January 26, 2026 | Insights

I had just come home after a 10-hour shift at my job. The Saturday night dinner crowd left me utterly exhausted. The worst part of it all was that I still had homework to do. So, I lugged myself to my bed, opened my Microsoft Surface tablet that I was using as my laptop, and got to work.

I opened the dashboard for my graphic design class and saw that we were moving from theory to hands-on work, so I opened Adobe Creative Cloud and looked for the software I would need for the next few weeks. While I was waiting for the apps to download, I decided to explore a little. What caught my eye were two apps that would prove to be my most valuable tools for the next 5 years: Premiere Pro and After Effects. I read the descriptions, hit download, and made a mental note to check them out the next day.

What started as curiosity turned into a second job and hundreds of projects. I went from a clueless 18-year-old watching every tutorial I could find to getting paid to help brands and creators tell stories that, in 2025, on one client's channel alone, generated almost 8.5 million hours of watch time.

And somewhere in those hundreds of hours of cutting, sound design, and trying to hold people's attention, along with my time studying for my bachelor’s degree in marketing, I started noticing patterns that had everything to do with getting people to consume.

## Storytelling Wins

We're currently living in an age of information. It’s estimated that we as humans are assaulted with the equivalent of over 100,000 words every day. That includes watching your favorite movies, scrolling through TikTok, or listening to the radio on your way to work. But I bet you can't remember the last advertisement you saw.

When your senses are bombarded with hundreds of sensory messages every minute, your brain tends to filter most of them out. The same goes for the media we consume. When I was trying to figure out how I was going to get my clients' audiences to stay and continue watching a video through to the end, I learned something very important: storytelling is what gets people to watch.

This makes sense if you think about it. When you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok, you probably see a lot of content that just gives you the information you're looking for straight up. _Do These 5 Things to Increase Engagement._  
_You NEED to Stop Doing These 10 Things If You Want to Grow._  
Sound familiar? In this new, growing age of generative AI, these types of posts are incessant. And I bet you scroll past almost every single one of them.

I was working for a fitness influencer a few years back, and he had the story down. Where he struggled was with his hooks. Almost every reel he made started with something like _10 Exercises to Get Your Abs to POP_ or _How to Lose 10 Pounds in 1 Month_. What do these opening lines make you think? To me, it just looks like he's going to give me a list of exercises to do and call it a day. And that's exactly what I told him. Thankfully, he was open to feedback and asked me what I would change for the weight loss video. This is what I gave him based on what he told me:

> "I signed up for a marathon next month, and I still feel out of shape. So, my goal for the next 30 days would be to lose 10 pounds. Here's how I got myself into top running shape before that time."

See the difference?

Compared to his previous content, this video ended up not only increasing his view count, but it also increased his engagement, watch time, and shares. He noticed this difference and applied a similar hook to the rest of his videos going forward, which subsequently led to an increase in those KPIs.

Why did this work?

Unlike the first example, this hook has a few important storytelling elements that almost every great story needs. It has a character (the fitness influencer), a specific problem (he feels he's out of shape for an upcoming marathon), and defined stakes (he has to lose a large amount of weight in a dauntingly short time). Anyone in the fitness space knows that losing 10 pounds in 30 days is difficult, so the viewer becomes immediately interested. Then, instead of promising just a list of tips, he promises to take us on a journey to _show_ how he accomplishes his goal.

Now that that's all said and done, and we have a good hook to complement a story-oriented video, what comes next? You've got your audience's attention, and they've already started to watch, but you've run into an issue. Your viewers don't continue watching. Why is that?

## It's Your Pacing

Imagine you're watching a movie, and the main character is about to receive life-changing news from his doctor. The music is building up, hopeful, and the main character begins tearing up. The camera is focused on his face, ready to capture his reaction. He knows what's coming. The camera doesn't move. We're still waiting for the news. Still waiting. Waiting. Finally, the doctor delivers the news, and the man breaks down.

Now imagine the same scene, but with a few changes. The camera pans to the protagonist's face. You can see his eyes well up with tears as he realizes what he's about to hear. After 2 seconds, the camera switches to the doctor. He has a smile on his face, he raises his arm, and the camera cuts to a shot of both men looking at each other, the doctor's hand on the protagonist's shoulder. He begins to speak, and the camera cuts one more time to the protagonist's face, the doctor's voice delivering the news. He breaks down into relieved tears, pulled into a strong hug by the doctor.

Which of these scenes felt better to you?

This is what we in the storytelling world call pacing, which is defined as the speed and rhythm at which a story is told. Hold a shot too long, and we feel trapped, awkward, and uncomfortable. Go through information too fast, and we feel overwhelmed, robbed of a satisfying resolution.

Pacing doesn't just apply to video content. Written content is equally affected by pacing as any other content medium. A dense paragraph with run-on sentences and no punctuation and lots of information and no structure and no breaks and...

You get the point.

No reader wants to read a wall of text, no matter how interesting or information-dense it is. But when you mess around with rhythm and control the pace, you keep the reader moving.

Short sentences feel urgent.

Longer sentences are good for building context, providing details, and giving readers space to think about and absorb what they're reading before moving on.

Even though paragraph breaks look aesthetically pleasing to the reader's eyes, that's not their only function. Look at this post, for example. Each paragraph has its own idea, fleshing it out and giving as much information as possible before moving on to another idea. They're like cuts in a video or movie; they help switch scenes, describe another object, or switch to another point of view.

Pacing is important for leading the viewer or reader through the story, and how they're led through depends on you. But as a marketer, you're probably wondering: How do I know any of this will actually work? How do I know someone will end up caring enough to keep reading or watching? It all comes down to one thing—probably the most important thing in connecting to your audience...

## Emotional Connection

I want you to look back and think about a few advertisements you DO remember. Was it a Subaru ad? Was it an ASPCA commercial? Maybe it was a Coca-Cola ad? Whatever the case, I’m willing to bet you remembered it because of one thing: it made you feel something. Maybe it made you laugh. Maybe it made you tear up or made you think of somebody you love.

The same thing applies to our previous examples. The fitness influencer’s original hook—_How to Lose 10 Pounds In 1 Month_—probably didn’t make you feel anything. What about the revised version? Did you feel curious? Did it make you feel anticipation? He was going to take us on a journey, and we wanted to see how he did that.

What about the pacing examples? When I described the endless shot of the protagonist’s face, you felt that discomfort and annoyance. But what did you feel when I described the version of the scene that played around with the rhythm of the scene and had frequent cuts? Even by just reading it, you felt what the protagonist was feeling. You were engaged, and you felt that emotional payoff.

This isn’t something I’ve just made up, either. When you watch Bender walk across the football field, fist raised to the song “Don’t You (Forget About Me) at the end of _The Breakfast Club_, you feel the urge to raise your own. When you walk into a clothing store and see posters of attractive young models, shapely mannequins, and preppy music, you feel more attractive yourself. Why does this happen?

When you see someone smiling, your brain fires the same neurons that would normally activate when you smile yourself. When you read about somebody else’s frustration, you feel it too. These things all activate the same neural pathways as if you were experiencing them yourself. They are called mirror neurons.

This is why effective storytelling with good pacing works. Our brains are wired for emotion, which is why simply telling a customer information doesn’t work. Sure, you can get into data or describe a product or service in detail, but everything we do as marketers—or anyone else who wants their content to be consumed—is to create an emotional response.

So, before you write your next landing page, caption, or hit post, remember that in this age of endless information, people won’t remember what you told them. They’ll remember how you made them feel.
