# What 5 Years of Freelance Video Editing Taught Me About Content Marketing
I'd just gotten home after a 10-hour shift at my serving job. The Saturday night dinner crowd left me utterly exhausted. The worst part of it all was I still had homework to do. So I lugged myself to my bed, opened my Microsoft Surface tablet that I was using as my laptop, and got to work.

I opened the dashboard for my graphic design class and saw that we were moving from theory to hands-on work, so I opened up Adobe Creative Cloud and looked for the software I would need for the next few weeks. While I was waiting for the apps to download, I decided to explore a little. What caught my eye were two apps that would prove to be my most valuable tools for the next 5 years: Premiere Pro and After Effects. I read through the descriptions, hit download, and made a mental note to check them out the next day.

What started as curiosity turned into a second job and hundreds of projects. I went from a clueless 18-year-old watching every tutorial I could find, to getting paid to help brands and creators tell stories that in 2025 on one client's channel alone, came to a total of almost 8.5 million hours of watch time.

And somewhere in those hundreds of hours of cutting, sound designing, and trying to hold people's attention, along with my time studying for my Bachelor's degree in marketing, I started noticing patterns that I have everything to do with getting people to consume. 

## Story Over Everything
We're currently living in an age of information. It's currently estimated that we as humans are assaulted with the equivalent of over 100,000 words every day. That includes watching your favorite movies, scrolling through TikTok, or listening to the radio on your way to work. But I bet you can't remember the last advertisement you saw.

When your senses are bombarded with hundreds of sensory messages every minute, your brain tends to filter most of it out. The same goes for the media we consume. When I was trying to figure out how I was going to get my clients' audiences to stay and continue watching a video through to the end, I learned something very important: storytelling is what gets people to watch. 

This makes sense if you think about it. When you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok, you probably see a lot of content that just gives you the information you're looking for straight up. "Do These 5 Things to Increase Engagement." "You NEED to Stop Doing These 10 Things If You Want to Grow." Sound familiar? In this new growing age of generative AI, these types of posts are even more common. And I bet you scroll past almost every single one of them. 

I was working for a fitness influencer a few years back, and he had the story down. Where he struggled was his hooks. Almost every reel he made started with something along the lines of "Top 10 Exercises to Get Your Abs to POP" or "How to Lose 10 Pounds in 1 Month". What do these opening lines make you think? To me, it just looks like he's going to give me a list of exercises to do and call it a day. And that's exactly what I told him. Thankfully he was open to feedback and asked me what I would change for the weight loss video. This is what I gave him based on what he told me:

> I signed up for a marathon next month, and I still felt out of shape. So my goal for the next 30 days would be to lose 10 pounds. Here's how I got myself into top running shape before that time.

See the difference?

Compared to his previous content, this video ended up not only increasing his view count, but it increased his engagement, watch time, and shares. He saw this difference and applied a similar hook to the rest of his videos moving forward, which subsequently resulted in an increase in those KPIs. 

Why did this work?

Unlike the first example, this hook has a few important storytelling elements that almost every great story needs. It has a character (him), a specific problem (he feels that he's out of shape for an upcoming marathon), and has defined stakes (he has to lose a large amount of weight in a dauntingly short amount of time). Anyone who's in the fitness space knows that 10 pounds in 30 days is a difficult task, so the viewer becomes immediately interested. Then, instead of promising just a list of tips, he promises to take us on a journey to *show* how he accomplishes his goal.

Now that that's all said and done, and we have a good hook to compliment a story oriented video, what comes next? You've got your audience's attention, and they've already started to watch, but you've run into an issue. Your viewers don't continue watching. Why is that?

## Good Pacing Makes a Story Consumable
Imagine you're watching a movie, and the main character is about to receive life-changing news from his doctor. The music is building up, hopeful, the main character begins tearing up. The camera is focused on his face, ready to capture his reaction. He knows what's coming. The camera doesn't move. We're still waiting on the news. Still waiting. Waiting. Finally, the doctor delivers the news and the man breaks down. 

Now imagine the same scene, but with a few changes. The camera pans to the protagonist's face. You can see his eyes well up with tears as he realizes what he's about to hear. After 2 seconds the camera switches to the doctor. He has a smile on his face, he raises his arm and the camera cuts to a shot of both men looking at each other, the doctor's hand on the protagonist's shoulder. He begins to speak, and the camera cuts one more time to the protagonists face, the doctor's voice delivering the news. He breaks down into relieved tears, pulled into a strong hug from the doctor.

Which of these scenes felt better to you?

This is what we in the storytelling world call *pacing*, which is defined as the speed and rhythm a story is told. Hold a shot too long, we feel trapped, awkward, and uncomfortable. Go through information too fast, and we feel overwhelmed, robbed of a satisfying resolution.

Pacing doesn't just apply to video content. Written content is equally affected by pacing as any other content medium. A dense paragraph with run-on sentences and no punctuation and lots of information and no structure and no breaks and...

You get the point. 

No reader wants to read a wall of text, no matter how interesting or information dense it is. But when you mess around with rhythm and control the pace, you keep the reader moving. 

Short sentences feel urgent.

Longer sentences are good for building context, providing details, and giving readers space to think about and absorb what they're reading before moving on. 

Even though paragraph breaks look aesthetically pleasing to the reader's eyes, that's not their only function. Take a look at this post for example. Each paragraph has its own idea, fleshing it out and giving as much information as possible before moving on to another idea. They're like cuts in a video or movie; they help switch scenes, describe another object, or switch to another point-of-view.

Pacing is important for leading the viewer or reader through the story, and how they're led through depends on you. But as a marketer, you're probably wondering: *How do I know any of this will actually work? How do I know someone will end up caring enough to keep reading or watching?* It all comes down to one thing—probably the most important thing in connecting to your audience...

## Emotion

**Structure:**

- **Connect back to previous sections** - Story, hooks, pacing - they're all techniques. But here's what they're all serving: emotion. You can have perfect story structure and lose people if they don't _feel_ anything. You can have terrible pacing but if you hit the right emotional note, people will stay.
- **Your editing insight** - Talk about what you learned from editing emotional moments. Maybe it's that the best emotional beats come from restraint, not manipulation. Or that emotion comes from specificity - the right detail at the right moment. Or that people don't remember information, they remember how you made them feel.
- **Why this matters for marketing** - Most marketing focuses on features, benefits, logic. But people make decisions emotionally and justify them rationally later. If your content doesn't make someone feel something - curiosity, frustration, hope, recognition - it doesn't matter how well-structured it is.
- **The application** - Before writing anything, ask: "What do I want them to feel?" Not think. Feel. Then reverse-engineer your story, hook, and pacing to create that emotion.
- **End with a callback** - Maybe circle back to that exhausted college kid downloading Premiere Pro, or the 8 million watch hours. Tie it together emotionally so the post itself demonstrates what you're teaching.
