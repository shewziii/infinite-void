# What 5 Years of Freelance Video Editing Taught Me About Marketing
I'd just gotten home after a 10-hour shift at my serving job. The Saturday night dinner crowd left me utterly exhausted. The worst part of it all was I still had homework to do. So I lugged myself to my bed, opened my Microsoft Surface tablet that I was using as my laptop, and got to work.

I opened the dashboard for my graphic design class and saw that we were moving from theory to hands-on work, so I opened up Adobe Creative Cloud and looked for the software I would need for the next few weeks. While I was waiting for the apps to download, I decided to explore a little. What caught my eye were two apps that would prove to be my most valuable tools for the next 5 years: Premiere Pro and After Effects. I read through the descriptions, hit download, and made a mental note to check them out the next day.

What started as curiosity turned into a second job and hundreds of projects. I went from a clueless 18-year old watching every tutorial I could find, to getting paid to help brands and creators tell stories that in 2025, on one client's channel alone, came to a total of almost 8 million hours of watch time.

And somewhere in those hundreds of hours of cutting, sound designing, and trying to hold people's attention, along with my time studying for my Bachelor's degree in marketing, I started noticing patterns that I have everything to do with getting people to consume.
