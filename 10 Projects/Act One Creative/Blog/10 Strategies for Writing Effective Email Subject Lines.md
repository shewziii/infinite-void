Subject lines are grossly underestimated. The whole point of a subject line is to get someone to open your email, yet so many people tend to just write whatever and call it a day. Let’s take a look at my inbox:

It’s a bit of a mess. I didn’t even notice most of these, let alone open them. If your inbox looks anything like mine (it probably does), then you also know how cluttered it can look. When you send an email without a well thought out subject line, the chances it’ll be opened are low.

Our brains have evolved to take the the most efficient path possible to the information we need based on patterns we notice. They filter out unnecessary information to conserve energy. Did you notice I used the word “the” twice at the beginning of this paragraph? The point is, subject lines need a lot more focus than most people give them.

So how can you improve your subject lines to increase your open rate and prevent your emails from being ignored or being sent to trash? That’s what you’re here to learn so let’s look at a few strategies to help optimize your subject line effectiveness.

## 10 Ways to Write Subject Lines That Get Your Emails Opened

### 1. Do Your Homework
This part is so simple, yet so important. No matter what you do, who you want to sell to, contact, or message, you need to do your homework. Who are their customers? What do they sell? What are they like? What is the industry like at the moment? These are things you need to know before you start even thinking about contacting them.

There isn’t much else to say about this as it’s self-explanatory, but I need to make sure you don’t skip this since it ties in to the rest of the strategies. Especially the next section.

### 2. Personalization

Personalization is a must in today’s world. AI tools and templates often forget to personalize messages since they’re meant to be as general as possible. However, in this age of information, marketers have more tools than ever before to make their messaging as personalized as possible

With those tools you can learn names, preferences, interests, and jobs. Just be careful not to overdo it since more and more people are using this, which can lead to recipients being aware of that tactic.

### 3. Be Specific

The more specific you are, the more likely readers will be interested. A subject line that is specific gives recipients information they want to read. How many things will you be talking about? How long until a subscription expires?

Being specific can also create a sense of urgency in the reader to take action. “Your trial expires soon” just doesn’t have the same impact as “Your trial expires in 5 days.”

### 4. Ask a question

Questions engage readers through curiosity. When we’re faced with a question, our brains instinctively want to answer it. Do you know what I mean? If that question is framed to expect an answer, then the reader may want to open your email just to see if they were right.

### 5. Address a Problem

If you’re a marketer or in sales, you’ve definitely heard the phrase, “people don’t buy products, they buy solutions.” The same applies here. If your subject line talks about a problem your reader has, they’ll only be more interested in opening your email.

This is where doing your homework comes in handy. Knowing about industry issues, problems they’re facing, and then writing a message that specifically demonstrates that knowledge also build your own credibility.

### 6. Use Emojis

Emojis are a great way to visually separate your email from the rest of an inbox. Take a look at your own email inbox and take note of what captures your attention first. Our brains process color before shapes, and our attention is drawn to bright or contrasting colors first—especially in a space where very little color is present.

Be careful not to over do it though. One emoji at the start of your subject line is enough to grab a viewer’s attention. Too many emojis in the subject line runs the risk of looking tacky and a bit like spam.

### 7. Don’t Trick Your Reader

People don’t like being tricked. Do not pretend that your email is a reply, a forwarded message, don’t create fake urgency, and don’t make the subject line clickbait. This is a tactic that a lot of spam emails incorporate, and people recognize that, so it’s better to stay away from this entirely.

### 8. Give Them a Call to Action

Sometimes people need a little push in order to take action on something. Telling them to claim something now, download their free guide, or anything along those lines creates a sense of urgency. But, like I said, that urgency has to be real.

### 9. Give Them a Cliffhanger
![Email from Nadine Burton. Subject Line says 'Is this holding you back?'](../../assets/blog/subjectLines/cliffhanger.png)

Our brains like to fill in missing information. They fill in gaps using past experiences, patterns, and memories. This comes from our instinctual need to facilitate fast, adaptive actions to determine whether something is a threat or not. Having missing information activates that process, and if it’s not readily available, we feel the need to uncover it.

Take a show for example. Imagine you just watched an episode of a true crime tv show. The detective just uncovered an incriminating clue as to who the killer was. The music swells, the camera is a close-up of the detective’s face, and the last thing they say is “Oh my God.”

And the episode ends.

Most people feel this need to know what happens next, and if the next episode hasn’t released yet, it might be the only thing they think about for the next week.

### 10. Just Be Human
People respond better when they receive messages from people who sound human. Writing a subject line IN ALL CAPS, using buzzwords, and writing like you’re *trying* to sell something are all off-putting. Trying to sound too professional can sound robotic, and trying to sound too trendy makes you look inexperienced.

The best way to write is to write like you talk. Imagine you’re standing in front of the person you’re sending the message to and write as if you were speaking to them.

## Final Thoughts
Effective subject lines are the difference between your emails being opened or being ignored. They require you to be thoughtful about what you’re writing.

Start with doing your homework, since you’ll be using the information you uncovered to write everything else, and allows you to be specific, talk about issues they care about, demonstrate experience, and makes it easier for you to find ways to pique their interest without seeming manipulative.

Marketers have so many tools at their disposal in this day and age, so make use of them. Conduct A/B tests and try out different things, then find what works for each audience. The subject line is your first impression, so make it count.
