We’ve all heard of the sales funnel. You run a few ads to hopefully create awareness for your product, your audience takes interest in the product, you offer a promotion or sale to create desire and encourage them to take action, and then the customer is guided through the store which leads to a purchase.

The funnel is simple, straightforward, and linear, which was great for a traditional sales and marketing model. However, with the growing use of digital tools and the shift to online retail, the way consumers go through the sales process has changed drastically in the last few decades.

Today, [around 80% of shoppers conduct their research online before making a decision. 60% of shoppers begin the consumer journey online.](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/survey-us-consumer-sentiment-during-the-coronavirus-crisis) This shift also changes the way we as marketers promote our products, with target marketing becoming a lot more accessible, and mass marketing and other undifferentiated strategies becoming less useful for niche products.

So, what makes the traditional sales model less effective in this digital age? The funnel ends the consumer journey at the purchase which is a misrepresentation of the way consumers make decisions. The consumer journey doesn’t end at the purchase. It can actually be the beginning of their journey. That leads us to the loyalty loop.

## What is the Loyalty Loop?
McKinsey & Company has developed the Loyalty Loop, which is a model that focuses on the ongoing relationship between a customer and a brand, meant to drive repeat purchases, customer lifetime value, and advocacy. It consists of 6 stages, which include consideration, evaluation, purchase, enjoyment, advocacy, and bond.

## Consideration
Customers begin researching a product or service or looking for something to solve a problem they may have. They tend to investigate products they already buy, know about, have been told about, or have experience with. If they don’t already have any experience with a product or service, then they’re likely looking for a solution online. Once something has their attention, they might consider looking more into a specific product.

## Evaluation
Once they have a few products in mind they are considering, they begin to look for more information on each product they found in the consideration phase. They look at features, ease of use, price, packaging, branding, and sometimes even the brands themselves. They evaluate alternatives to see which one will give them the most value for their money.

## Purchase
Once the customer has come to a decision, they make a purchase. In the traditional sales funnel, this is where the journey comes to an end. It assumes that the customer will go through this process again when searching for another product or purchasing a product again, but I want you to ask yourself something. When was the last time you bought something only once? If something were to happen to it, would you buy it again?

The loyalty loop considers the experience a customer has or has had with a product or service, and continues on as the customer makes repeat purchases or decides to try something else.

## Enjoyment
Enjoyment is the amount of perceived value a customer receives from a product. Their enjoyment can change depending on a multitude of factors, like changes in packaging, quality, price, or even the actions of the brand.

Any of these can either increase or decrease customer enjoyment and drive future decisions for making purchases.

## Advocacy
When a customer receives a good level of enjoyment from a product or service, they often feel the need to share that enjoyment with others. For example, let’s say you decided to try out a new brand of frozen pizza, and it turns out to be the best thing you’ve ever tasted. Many people would go to family and friends saying, “you’ve got to try this brand out! It’s so good!”

Often this enthusiasm for a product or service will lead to them taking to the digital space to comment on the brand’s social media or leave a review on their website. 

## Bond
This stage marks the consumer’s loyalty to a product, service, or brand. They decide which will bring them the most value and stick with it, leading them to make the same purchase until they find a better alternative for their needs. This leads to consumers making repeat and automatic purchases, not having to think about alternatives or trying something new, which is where brands want their products or services to be.

Take dish soap for example. Most people will buy the same brand of dish soap for most of their adult life. Maybe it started with your parents, maybe you like the smell of a specific one, or maybe you just bought it one day and stuck with it.

Unless you incidentally come across another brand of dish soap, or the current brand of dish soap you’ve always bought changes something that affects your enjoyment of it such as raised prices or effectiveness, you probably won’t have any need to look for alternatives.

## The Loop Can Start Anywhere
Unlike the traditional sales funnel model, the loyalty loop doesn’t have a definitive starting point. Let’s say you’ve received a coffee maker as a birthday gift. This skips the consideration, evaluation, and purchase stages immediately. You go straight to the enjoyment stage when you set it up to use it.

If you like it, you’ll continue to use it. You take note of the brand name, tell your friends about it to advocate for it, and you decide that this is the coffee maker for you. The loyalty you have to it that was built during the bond stage helps you make future decisions. If anything ever happens to the coffee maker, you will probably decide to just buy the same model again.

Maybe your family has always used the same brand of laundry detergent. You’ve already built a bond to that product and that is what drives your decisions to buy in the future. You probably won’t even go through consideration or evaluation since the purchase will most likely be automatic.

## Rethinking the Consumer Journey
The loyalty loop changes the way marketers should think about the consumer journey. A customer’s relationship with a product, service, or brand doesn’t end with a purchase, but evolves over time through the experiences they have. That means marketers and salespeople—now more than ever—need to think about customers not as transactions, but as people.

As shopping moves toward an online-first approach, customers now have access to more information than ever before, with the ability to pull up reviews and alternatives by just pulling out their phones. That has led to brands needing to push out quality products and services consistently, lest they end up receiving negative reviews.

Keeping up consistency with product quality and brand integrity is the best way to reach the bond stage where customers build loyalty to a brand and want to advocate for that product and keep buying it. In other words, we must provide value at every step in the consumer journey. 

If a customer has one bad experience, it can push them out of the loop and into the consideration stage as they look for a better experience with another brand. If their experience is phenomenal, they’ll move to advocacy and bond which drives them to repeat purchases.

All this to say, brands that succeed aren’t always those with the largest marketing budgets, but the ones who understand the importance of customer relationships and treat the consumer journey as an ongoing endeavor.
